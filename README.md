# hello-world
This is my very first repository...which is apparently different from a codespace...

**My name is Alec and I am trying to learn GitHub because I think it will be fun!**

If I could master this...then maybe i can realize my dreams of making modules for Foundry

_That's not really a dream I have._

Veronica thinks I am a crazy mutant
